Paid support option (available in the US and in select European and Middle Eastern countries)

If you see other Yahoo product and password support phone numbers or services posted online, these aren't Yahoo phone numbers or services and you aren't working with Yahoo Customer Care. Always make sure the Yahoo support site you're using has a web address that ends with yahoo.com.
